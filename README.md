# Parent Private Lectures App folder

This repository holds source files for a docker hosted db, and as submodule, the app Private Lectures.

Upon cloning, this repository is meant to bear as subfolder the [*private_lectures* app repository](https://github.com/fernandoroa/private_lectures_rs_challenge)
too.

This repository holds docker related files and the database files to make to app work

Specifics about cloning and running the app will stay on the [*README.md* of the *private lectures* repository](https://github.com/fernandoroa/private_lectures_rs_challenge)

The `db_private_lectures` folder is meant to create the db for the docker db image.

The `data.json` file is kept for the record only; now the app uses a database, see `docker-compose.yml`
